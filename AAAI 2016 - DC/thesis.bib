Abstract = {Experimental results suggest that transfer learning (TL), compared to learning from scratch, can decrease exploration by reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Most existing TL algorithms for RL are heuristic and may result in worse performance than learning from scratch (i.e., negative transfer). We introduce a theoretically grounded and flexible approach that transfers action-values via an intertask mapping and, based on those, explores the target task systematically. We characterize positive transfer as (1) decreasing sample complexity in the target task compared to the sample complexity of the base RL algorithm (without transferred action-values) and (2) guaranteeing that the algorithm converges to a near-optimal policy (i.e., negligible optimality loss). The sample complexity of our approach is no worse than the base algorithm’s, and our analysis reveals that positive transfer can occur even with highly inaccurate and partial intertask mappings. Finally, we empirically test directed exploration with transfer in a multijoint reaching task, which highlights the value of our analysis and the robustness of our approach under imperfect conditions.},

	abstract={Coordinating the actions of agents in multiagent systems presents a challenging problem, especially as the size of the system is increased and predicting the agent interactions becomes difficult. Many approaches to improving coordination within multiagent systems have been developed including organizational structures, shaped rewards, coordination graphs, heuristic methods, and learning automata. However, each of these approaches still have limitations with respect to scalability. The goal of this paper is to combine two such coordination mechanisms (difference rewards and hierarchical organization) to improve scalability. We combine difference rewards and hierarchical organizations in the Defect Combination Problem (DCP) with 10,000 sensing agents. We show that combining these techniques results in significantly improved performance and robustness compared to either approach individually. In particular, we show that combining hierarchical organization with difference rewards can improve both coordination and scalability by decreasing information overhead, structuring agent-to-agent connectivity and control flow, and improving the individual decision making capabilities of agents.},

	abstract={Wave energy converters promise to be a viable alternative to current electrical generation methods. However, these generators must become more efficient before wide-scale industrial use can become cost-effective. The efficiency of these devices is primarily dependent upon their geometry and ballast configuration which are both difficult to evaluate, due to slow computation time and high computation cost of current models.
In this paper, we use evolutionary algorithms to optimize the ballast geometry of a wave energy generator using a two step process. First, we generate  a  function approximator (neural network) to predict wave energy converter power output with respect to key geometric design variables. This is a critical step as the computation time of using a full model (e.g., AQWA) to predict energy output prohibits the use of an evolutionary algorithm for design optimization. The function approximator  reduced the computation time by over 99\% while having an average error of only 3.5\%.  The evolutionary algorithm then optimized the weight distribution of a wave energy generator, resulting in an  84\% improvement in power output over a ballast-free wave energy converter.

abstract ={Motivation: Sampling the conformational space is a fundamental step for both ligand- and structure-based drug design. However, the rational organization of different molecular conformations still remains a challenge. In fact, for drug design applications, the sampling process provides a redundant conformation set whose thorough analysis can be intensive, or even prohibitive. We propose a statistical approach based on cluster analysis aimed at rationalizing the output of methods such as Monte Carlo, genetic, and reconstruction algorithms. Although some software already implements clustering procedures, at present, a universally accepted protocol is still missing.Results: We integrated hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis with a clusterability assessment method and a user independent cutting rule, to form a global protocol that we implemented in a MATLAB metalanguage program (AClAP). We tested it on the conformational space of a quite diverse set of drugs generated via Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation, and on the poses we obtained by reiterated docking runs performed by four widespread programs. In our tests, AClAP proved to remarkably reduce the dimensionality of the original datasets at a negligible computational cost. Moreover, when applied to the outcomes of many docking programs together, it was able to point to the crystallographic pose.Availability: AClAP is available at the “AClAP” section of the website http://www.scfarm.unibo.it.Contact: E-mail: andrea.cavalli@unibo.it.Supplementary Information: The complete series of AClAP results is available in the “services” section of the website http://www.scfarm.unibo.it.},

	to cooperate as a team in situations where they have limited prior

	ad hoc team members, i.e., agents that will be able to cooperate
	without coordination in order to reach an optimal team behavior.
	This paper considers the problem of leading N-agent teams by an agent
	toward their optimal joint utility, where the agents compute their
	next actions based only on their most recent observations of their
	teammatesâ€™ actions. We show that compared to previous results in
	two-agent teams, in larger teams the agent might not be able to lead
	the team to the action with maximal joint utility, thus its optimal
	strategy is to lead the team to the best possible reachable cycle
	of joint actions. We describe a graphical model of the problem and
	a polynomial time algorithm for solving it. We then consider other
	variations of the problem, including leading teams of agents where
	they base their actions on longer history of past observations, leading
	a team by more than one ad hoc agent, and leading a teammate while
	the ad hoc agent is uncertain of its behavior. },

  abstract = {Intelligent air traffic flow management is one of the fundamental
	challenges facing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today.
	FAA estimates put weather, routing decisions and airport condition
	induced delays at 1,682,700 hours in 2007, resulting in a staggering
	economic loss of over $41 Billion. New solutions to the flow management
	are needed to accommodate the threefold increase in air traffic anticipated
	over the next two decades. Indeed, this is a complex problem where
	the interactions of changing conditions (e.g., weather), conflicting
	priorities (e.g., different airlines), limited resources (e.g., air
	traffic controllers) and heavy volume (e.g., over 40,000 flights
	over the US airspace) demand an adaptive and robust solution. In
	this paper we explore a multiagent algorithm where agents use reinforcement
	learning to reduce congestion through local actions. Each agent is
	associated with a fix (a specific location in 2D space) and has one
	of three actions: setting separation between airplanes, ordering
	ground delays or performing reroutes. We simulate air traffic using
	FACET which is an air traffic flow simulator developed at NASA and
	used extensively by the FAA and industry. Our FACET simulations on
	both artificial and real historical data from the Chicago and New
	York airspaces show that agents receiving personalized rewards reduce
	congestion by up to 80\% over agents receiving a global reward and
	by up to 90\% over a current industry approach (Monte Carlo estimation).},

  abstract = { The ability to analyze the effectiveness of agent reward structures
	is critical to the successful design of multiagent learning algorithms.
	Though final system performance is the best indicator of the suitability
	of a given reward structure, it is often preferable to analyze the
	reward properties that lead to good system behavior (i.e., properties
	promoting coordination among the agents and providing agents with
	strong signal to noise ratios). This step is particularly helpful
	in continuous, dynamic, stochastic domains ill-suited to simple table
	backup schemes commonly used in TD(\lambda)/Q-learning where the
	effectiveness of the reward structure is difficult to distinguish
	from the effectiveness of the chosen learning algorithm. In this
	paper, we present a new reward evaluation method that provides a
	visualization of the tradeoff between the level of coordination among
	the agents and the difficulty of the learning problem each agent
	faces. This method is independent of the learning algorithm and is
	only a function of the problem domain and the agents' reward structure.
	We use this reward property visualization method to determine an
	effective reward without performing extensive simulations. We then
	test this method in both a static and a dynamic multi-rover learning
	domain where the agents have continuous state spaces and take noisy
	actions (e.g., the agents' movement decisions are not always carried
	out properly). Our results show that in the more difficult dynamic
	domain, the reward efficiency visualization method provides a two
	order of magnitude speedup in selecting good rewards, compared to
	running a full simulation. In addition, this method facilitates the
	design and analysis of new rewards tailored to the observational
	limitations of the domain, providing rewards that combine the best
	properties of traditional rewards.},

  pages = {359-387},
  abstract = {We consider the problem of designing the the utility functions of
	the utility-maximizing agents in a multi-agent system (MAS) so that
	they work synergistically to maximize a global utility. The particular
	problem domain we explore is the control of network routing by placing
	agents on all the routers in the network. Conventional approaches
	to this task have the agents all use the Ideal Shortest Path routing
	Algorithm (ISPA). We demonstrate that in many cases, due to the side-effects
	of one agent's actions on another agent's performance, having agents
	use ISPA's is suboptimal as far as global aggregate cost is concerned,
	even when they are only used to route infinitesimally small amounts
	of traffic. The utility functions of the individual agents are not
	"aligned" with the global utility, intuitively speaking. As a particular
	example of this we present an instance of Braess' paradox in which
	adding new links to a network whose agents all use the ISPA results
	in a <em>decrease</em> in overall throughput. We also demonstrate
	that load-balancing, in which the agents' decisions are collectively
	made to optimize the global cost incurred by all traffic <em>currently</em>
	being routed, is suboptimal as far as global cost <em>averaged across
	time</em> is concerned. This is also due to "side-effects", in this
	case of current routing decision on future traffic. The mathematics
	of Collective Intelligence (COIN) is concerned precisely with the
	issue of avoiding such deleterious side-effects in multi-agent systems,
	both over time and space. We present key concepts from that mathematics
	and use them to derive an algorithm whose ideal version should have
	better performance than that of having all agents use the ISPA, even
	in the infinitesimal limit. We present experiments verifying this,
	and also showing that a machine-learning-based version of this COIN
	algorithm in which costs are only imprecisely estimated via empirical
	means (a version potentially applicable in the real world) also outperforms
	the ISPA, despite having access to less information than does the
	ISPA. In particular, this COIN algorithm almost always avoids Braess'
	paradox.},
