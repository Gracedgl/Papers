\opening{To the AAAI-15 Robotics Fellowship Committee,} 
Attending AAA-15 gives me an excellent opportunity to learn how the AI community can assist in my dissertation topic. During the next year I will be preparing my proposal, and by attending AAAI-15 I have the opportunity to discuss my research directions with experts in the field before appearing before my committee. 

My research involves Learning from Demonstration techniques for individuals with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Learning from Demonstration is a wide field that has had much attention in the last few years, however, experiments usually involve demonstrations with able-bodied experts. I would like to discuss these issues with the AAAI-15 robotics community, as they require solutions involving highly suboptimal demonstrations during learning. 

I have traditionally been to multiagent learning conferences, but transitioned to single agent robotics after achieving my Masters degree. This leaves me relatively inexperienced in the current state of the art in robotic artificial intelligence. Attending AAAI-15 would greatly expand my knowledge in this field.
